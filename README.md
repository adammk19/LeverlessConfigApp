### Recommendations

If you're new to Rapid Trigger and HE key switch devices, I recommend the following settings so you can get over the learning curve quickly:
- 1.5mm - 2mm actuation point
- Continuous Rapid Trigger so you can get a feel for how RT works
- RT Sensitivity of 0.3mm which you can then lower down to 0.1mm or 0.2mm (more forgiving) once you get comfortable with RT

My personal settings:
- 0.7mm actuation point on movement buttons, 1.8mm actuation point on action buttons
- Continuous Rapid Trigger
- 0.1mm RT Sensitivity
